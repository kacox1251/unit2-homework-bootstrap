# unit1-homework-portfolio

## Description

This is the portfolio remade with Bootstrap for the Unit 2 Homework.
This project requied me to use Bootstrap to format my portfolio to make it responsive and streamline the css. It is definitely much easier to utilize tool such as Bootstrap for your webpages. It isn't without it's own struggle. I had some trouble incoorporating my own styles in with the styles provided with Bootstrap. I hope you enjoy the changes I made.
